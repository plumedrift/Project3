Design Explanation
==================

I thought it best to use the input array and to sort in place, fulfilling the
requirement of a single traversal.

Space Efficiency
================

**O(1)**:   Because there are only 3 variables that will be created, regardless of input size,
            we can say that the space complexity is constant-time.

Time Efficiency
===============

O(n):   In the worst case, there are no 2s and we have to go to the very end of the input_list.
        This makes the while loop iterate n times, resulting in O(n) since all the other operations
        are constant-time.
