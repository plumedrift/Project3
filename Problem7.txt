Design Explanation
==================

I chose to add the Home Page handler when my program initializes the RouteTrie because I thought
that would be useful. I also decided to implement the 'not found handler' as well as the trailing slashes
scenario.

Space Efficiency
================

O(n)    where n is the number of unique words between '/'s that have been inserted into the trie.
        Just like in P5, each level of the trie is distinct, so a first-level node will be different from a second-level
        node, even if the words are the same.

Time Efficiency
===============

O(n) for both find() and insert() functions. They both iterate similarly through the levels of the trie,
        and will not go deeper than the number of words separated by slashes. This is n, which will be bounded
        by the height of the trie.
