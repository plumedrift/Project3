Design Explanation
==================

I chose to add the Home Page handler when my program initializes the RouteTrie because I thought
that would be useful. I also decided to implement the 'not found handler' as well as the trailing slashes
scenario.

Space Efficiency
================

**O(1)**    find() creates no additional structures
**O(n)**    insert() can create up to n additional TrieNodes, if they are all unique (they don't
            already exist in the Trie).

Time Efficiency
===============

O(n) for both find() and insert() functions. They both iterate similarly through the levels of the trie,
        and cannot go deeper than the number of words separated by slashes. This is n, which will be bounded
        by the height of the trie.
