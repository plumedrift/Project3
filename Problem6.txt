Design Explanation
==================

There were no additional structures needed. Decided to simply track the current min and max
as I traversed the input-list.

Space Efficiency
================

O(n):   No additional space needed, just the original list.

Time Efficiency
===============

O(n):   With a single traversal, and only constant-time operations in that loop,
        the time complexity is O(n)
