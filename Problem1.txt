Design Explanation
==================

I chose to use an array to hold the possible integer solutions because working
on the indices to split the structure in halves seemed like the most elegant
way to go about it.

Space Efficiency
================

O(n)    because there is the original list of n elements, and then we create new lists
        with each layer of recursion. The infinite series 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... reduces to 1,
        so we end up with O(2n) which can reduce to O(n)

Time Efficiency
===============

O(log n)    because every operation within the functions take constant time, but we will recur
            log n times, because we are halving the total size with each recurrence.
